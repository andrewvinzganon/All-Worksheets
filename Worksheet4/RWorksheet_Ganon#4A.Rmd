Datar <- read.csv("HouseData.csv")

#a. the data shows the different shoe sizes, height and the gender of the people in the household.

#b. 
male <- subset(Datar, Gender == "M" & Shoe.size&Height)
male

female <- subset(Datar, Gender == "F" & Shoe.size&Height)
female
```
#c
mean1 <- mean(Datar$Shoe.size)
mean1
mean2 <- mean(Datar$Height)
mean2

#d
yes there is a relationship between the size of the male and the female shoe size and height.
